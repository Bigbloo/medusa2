In this chapter, you'll learn how you can use AI assistants and LLMs effectively in your Medusa development.

## AI Assistant in Documentation

The Medusa documentation is equipped with an AI Assistant that can answer your questions and help you build customizations with Medusa.

### Open the AI Assistant

To open the AI Assistant, either:

- Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + I` for Windows/Linux, or `Cmd + I` for macOS.
- Click the <InlineIcon Icon={AiAssistent} alt="AI Assistant" /> icon in the top right corner of the documentation.

You can then ask the AI Assistant any questions about Medusa, such as:

- What is a workflow?
- How to create a product review module?
- How to update Medusa?
- How to fix this error?

The AI Assistant will provide you with relevant documentation links, code snippets, and explanations to help you with your development.

### Ask About Code Snippets

While browsing the documentation, you'll find a <InlineIcon Icon={AiAssistentLuminosity} alt="AI Assistant" /> icon in the header of code snippets. You can click this icon to ask the AI Assistant about the code snippet.

The AI Assistant will analyze the code and provide explanations, usage examples, and any additional information you need to understand how the code works.

### Ask About Documentation Pages

If you need more help understanding a specific documentation page, you can click the "Explain with AI Assistant" link in the page's right sidebar. This will open the AI Assistant and provide context about the current page, allowing you to ask questions related to the content.

### Formatting and Code Blocks

In your questions to the AI Assistant, you can format code blocks by wrapping them in triple backticks (```). For example:

~~~markdown
```
console.log("Hello, World!")
```
~~~

You can add new lines using the `Shift + Enter` shortcut.

## Plain Text Documentation

The Medusa documentation is available in plain text format, which allows LLMs and AI tools to easily parse and understand the content.

You can access the following plain text documentation files:

- [llms.txt](https://docs.medusajs.com/llms.txt) - Contains a short structure of links to important documentation pages.
- [llms-full.txt](https://docs.medusajs.com/llms-full.txt) - Contains the full documentation content, including all pages and sections.
- **Markdown version of any page** - You can access the Markdown version of any documentation page by appending `/index.html.md` to the page URL. For example, the plain text content of the current page is available at [https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/introduction/build-with-llms-ai/index.html.md](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/introduction/build-with-llms-ai/index.html.md).

You can provide these files to your AI tools or LLM editors like [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-docs). This will help them understand the Medusa documentation and provide better assistance when building customizations or answering questions.
